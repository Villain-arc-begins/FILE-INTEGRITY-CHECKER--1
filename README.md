 ## Overview of the Project
 This project is a **FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER**, designed to monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing the hash values for the file integrity.
 Key Features
1. File Hash Generation
Computes the cryptographic hash SHA-256 of a file.
Reads the file in chunks and very effective making it suitable for small and large files.
2. Integrity Verification
Compares the computed hash of a file against a user-provided expected hash.
Ensures the file is unaltered or changed and verifies its authenticity.
3. Customizable Hash Algorithms
Supports multiple hash algorithms like SHA-256, MD5, SHA-512, and others.
Users can specify the algorithm that best suits their requirements.
4.Platform Compatibility
Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in hashlib library, requiring no additional installations.
5. User-Friendly Output
Provides clear and detailed feedback:
Displays the computed hash value.
Indicates whether the file integrity check passed or failed.
6. Error Handling
Handles common issues like invalid file paths, unsupported algorithms, and read errors gracefully.
Prints user-friendly error messages to assist with debugging.
