 ## Overview of the Project
 This project is a **FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER**, designed to monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing the hash values for the file integrity.

 ## Key Features

**1. File Hash Generation**
This program works out the SHA-256 cryptographic hash of a file. It goes through the file bit by bit, which makes it good for files of any size.

**2. Integrity Verification**
It matches the worked-out hash of a file with a hash the user expects. This makes sure the file hasn't been changed and proves it's still intact.

**3. Customizable Hash Algorithms** 
It works with many hash algorithms like SHA-256, MD5 SHA-512, and others. Users can pick the algorithm that fits what they need.

**4.Platform Compatibility** 
It uses Python's built-in hashlib library, so you don't need to install anything extra it also tells you if the file integrity check worked or not.

**5. Error Handling**
It deals well with common problems like wrong file paths, algorithms it can't use, and reading errors. It shows error messages in a way that helps users figure out what went wrong.
